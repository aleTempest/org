   a) 2
   b) Western Europe
   c) 601
   d) Producto is in stock
   e) =new_locn= is not in scope at position 2
2.
   1. Because the inner block declares its own variables with the same names
      =v_employee_id= and =v_job=.
   2. Despite having the same names, do not
      affect the outer block's variables since they have separate scopes.
   3. The code as follows:
      #+begin_src sql
    DECLARE
        v_employee_id employees.employee_id%TYPE;
        v_job employees.job_id%TYPE;
    BEGIN
        SELECT employee_id, job_id INTO v_employee_id, v_job
        FROM employees
        WHERE employee_id = 100;
    END;
/

    DECLARE inner_block;
    BEGIN
        SELECT employee_id, job_id INTO v_employee_id, v_job
        FROM employees
        WHERE employee_id = 103;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employee_id || ' is a(n) ' || v_job);
    END inner_block;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_employee_id || ' is a(n) ' || v_job);
      #+end_src
