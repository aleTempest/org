1.  Declarations

    1.  Which of the following variable declarations are valid?

        1.  Valid
        2.  Invalid
        3.  Invalid
        4.  Valid

    2.  For the invalid declarations above, describe why they are
        invalid.

        1.  B option: All strings must be inside quotation marks.
        2.  C option: Variables must be initialized during declaration.

    3.  Write an anonymous block in which you declare and print (on the
        screen) each of thevariables in 1A above, correcting the invalid
        declarations and adding information as needed.

        ``` sql
        DECLARE
            number_of_students PLS_INTEGER := 30;
            student_name VARCHAR2(10) := 'Johnson';
            stu_per_class CONSTANT NUMBER := 1;
            today DATE := SYSDATE + 1;
        BEGIN
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('The number of students is:' || number_of_students || '.');
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('The name of the students is:' || student_name || '.');
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('The number of students per class is:' || stu_per_class || '.');
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Tomorrows date is: ' || today || '.');
        END
        ```

2.  Evaluate the variables in the following code. Answer the following
    questions about each variable. Is it named well? Why or why not? If
    it is not named well, what would be a better name and why?

    ``` sql
    DECLARE
        country_name VARCHAR2(50);
        median_age  NUMBER(6, 2);
    BEGIN
    SELECT country_name, median_age INTO country_name, median_age
        FROM countries
    WHERE country_name = 'Japan';
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The median age in '|| country_name
                                  || ' is ' || median_age || '.');
    END;
    ```

    **The two variables have the same name as the database columns.**

3.  Change the declarations in 2) above so they use the %TYPE attribute

    1.  `country_name wf_countries.country_name%TYPE;`{.verbatim}
    2.  `median_age wf_countries.median_age%TYPE;`{.verbatim}

4.  In your own words, describe why using the %TYPE attribute is better
    than hard-coding data types. Can you explain how you could run into
    problems in the future by hard-coding the data types of the
    country~name~ and median~age~ variables in question 2?

    **It\'s more sustainable in the future, it brings adaptability and
    reduces maintenance**

5.  Create the following anonymous block:

    ``` sql
    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
    END;
    ```

    1.  Add a declarative section to this PL/SQL block. In the
        declarative section, declare the following variables:

        1.  A variable named TODAY of datatype DATE. Initialize TODAY
            with SYSDATE.

        2.  A variable named TOMORROW with the same datatype as TODAY.
            Use the %TYPE attribute

            ``` sql
            DECLARE
                today DATE:=SYSDATE;
                tomorrow today%TYPE;
            BEGIN
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
            END;
            ```

    2.  In the executable section, initialize the TOMORROW variable with
        an expression that calculates tomorrow's date (add 1 to the
        value in TODAY). Print the value of TODAY and TOMORROW after
        printing 'Hello World'.

        ``` sql
        DECLARE
            today DATE:=SYSDATE;
            tomorrow today%TYPE;
        BEGIN
            tomorrow := today + 1;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(today);
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(tomorrow);
        END;
        ```
