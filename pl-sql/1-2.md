    3.  Security: PL/SQL allows for fine-grained access control and
        enhances database security.

3.  How is PL/SQL different from C and Java? List three differences.

    PL/SQL is primarily used for database programming and stored
    procedures, while C and Java are general-purpose programming
    languages.

4.  List three examples of what you can build with PL/SQL code.

    1.  Stored Procedures and Functions

    2.  Triggers

    3.  Data transformation
