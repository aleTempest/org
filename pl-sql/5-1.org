* Vocabulary

1. ROWTYPE Declares a record with the same fields as the cursor on which it is based
2. TYPE a composite data type consisting of a group of related data items stored as fields, each with its own name and data type

* Try/Solve It
1. Excecute following code and save it.
    #+begin_src sql
DECLARE
    v_dept_id DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID%TYPE;
    v_dept_name DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_NAME%TYPE;
    v_mgr_id DEPARTMENTS.MANAGER_ID%TYPE;
    v_loc_id DEPARTMENTS.LOCATION_ID%TYPE;
BEGIN
    SELECT department_id,department_name,manager_id,location_id
    INTO v_dept_id,v_dept_name,v_mgr_id,v_loc_id
    FROM DEPARTMENTS WHERE department_id = 80;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_dept_id || ' ' || v_dept_name || ' '
        || v_mgr_id || ' ' || v_loc_id);
EXCEPTION WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Department does not exist');
END;
    #+end_src

2. Explain the advantage of using =%ROWTYPE= to declare a record structure.

   You don't need to specify the type of the table explicitly.
