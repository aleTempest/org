* Vocabulary
1. Store large blocks of single-byte or fixed-width multi-byte NCHAR data in the database.

   *NCLOB*

2. Hold values, called locators, that specify the location of large objects (such as graphic images) that are stored out of line.

   *LOB*

3. Hold a single value with no internal components.

   *Scalar*

4. Store large unstructured or structured binary objects.

   *BLOB*

5. Contain internal elements that are either scalar (record) or composite (record and table).

   *Composite*

6. Store large binary files outside of the database.

   *BFILE*

7. Hold values, called pointers, that point to a storage location.

   *Reference*

8. A schema object with a name, attributes, and methods.

1. In your own words, describe what a data type is and explain why it is important.

   A data type is a classification or category that specifies which type of value a variable or column can hold. It defines the format and the operations that can be performed on the data.

2. Identify the three data type categories covered in this course.

   1. LOB
   2. Scalar
   3. Composite

3. Identify three data types covered in the Database Programming with SQL course.
   1. Number
   2. Date
   3. Varchar2

4. What data type can be used in PL/SQL, but can’t be used to define a table column?

   *Boolean*

5. Which data type indicates a large data object that is stored outside of the database?

   *BFILE*

6. Identify the data type category (LOB, Scalar, or Composite) for each data type. Each category may be used more than once.
  | Data Type   | Data Type Category |
  |-------------+--------------------|
  | CLOB        | LOB                |
  | VARCHAR2    | Scalar             |
  | BLOB        | LOB                |
  | NUMBER      | Scalar             |
  | BFILE       | LOB                |
  | TIMESTAMP   | Scalar             |
  | NCLOB       | LOB                |
  | RECORD      | Composite          |
  | PLS_INTEGER | Scalar             |
  | LONG        | Scalar             |
  | TABLE       | Composite          |
  | BOOLEAN     | Scalar             |

7. Enter the data type category and the data type for each value.
   1. ‘Switzerland’
      Scalar =VARCHAR2=
   2. Text of a resume
      Scalar =VARCHAR2=
   3. 100.20
      Scalar =NUMBER=
   4. A picture
      =LOB BLOB=
   5. 1053
      Scalar =NUMBER=
   6. 11-Jun-2016
      Scalar =DATE=
   7. ‘Computer science is the science of the 21 st century.’
      Scalar =VARCHAR2=
   8. Following table:
    | Index | Last_name |
    |-------+-----------|
    |     1 | 'Newman'  |
    |     2 | 'Raman'   |
    |     3 | 'Han'     |

    Composite Table

   9. A movie
      =LOB BFILE=
   10. A sound byte
       =LOB BFILE=
   11. FALSE
       Scalar =BLOB=
